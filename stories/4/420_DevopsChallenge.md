# Challenge 4.1.5 - Continuous Delivery to Kubernetes using VSTS

Using Visual Studio Team Services will help our development and operations department to have a proper team environment to efficientely provide new stable releases into production. The main goal of this challenge is to automatically post a new release of our code into our production kubernetes cluster starting from a single git commit.

## Resources

* Understanding of DevOps concepts like [Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery and, Build and Release Management](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/build/get-started/ci-cd-part-1).
* Access to Azure subscription.
* [Visual Studio Team Services account.](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/)
* [Installing the Kubernetes extension for VSTS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tsuyoshiushio.k8s-endpoint)

## Suggestion on how to accomplish this challenge

For the sake of this exercise, **lets focus only on the API code** and any new releases you can have. These changes will be tested by VSTS and, pushed into ACR once all your tests have passed (You should provide your own tests). Then VSTS will automatically deploy the last version of the app into your cluster by obtaining the latest image from the ACR.

The following two resources will provide you all the answers on how to accomplish this task, itÂ´s your duty to understand them and consolidate the concepts to set up a full development cycle:

1. [CI/CD to Kubernetes clusters using VSTS](https://github.com/dtzar/blog/tree/master/CD-Kubernetes-VSTS)
1. [Build and deploy your ASP.NET Core app to Azure](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/build/apps/aspnet/aspnetcore-to-azure#enable-continuous-integration-ci)


1. Create an acccount and a new project in [Visual Studio Team Services](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/).
1. Add or connect your API 
1. Install the VSTS Kubernetes [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tsuyoshiushio.k8s-endpoint).

* Provide Continuous Integration with VSTS by pushing your docker images into the ACR
