# Task 4.1.2 - Create API endpoint 

## Prerequisites 

* [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) (Stable channel)
* [.NET Core SDK 1.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core)

### Configuring Docker

You'll need to share your drive with Docker in order to build images.

1. Open up Docker settings by right-clicking the Docker icon in the taskbar, and choosing Settings
2. Go to the `Shared Drives` tab and share the C drive ![image of share screen](images/docker-sharedrive.png)

## Creating a .NET Core App

### 1. Create a New WebAPI Project

We'll use the dotnet cli to create a new .NET Core WebAPI project. In a terminal, run:

```
mkdir api && cd api
dotnet new webapi
```

These commands get you started with a basic WebAPI project in the `api` folder with a single controller. Let's test it out to make sure everything is working properly. In the terminal, run:

```
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:5000/api/values/5](http://localhost:5000/api/values/5) to see your app running. Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the API

### 2. Add functionality

Let's make a small change to the API so that it responds to our inputs. Modify the code in `/Controllers/ValuesController.cs` with the following

#### Before
```csharp
// GET api/values/5
[HttpGet("{id"})]
public string Get(int id)
{
  return "value";
}
```

#### After
```csharp
// GET api/values/5
[HttpGet("{id"})]
public string Get(int id)
{
  return $"The value is {id}";
}
```

Using the terminal again, let's run the project to see our changes

```
dotnet run
```

This time, when you navigate to [http://localhost:5000/api/values/5](http://localhost:5000/api/values/5), you should see "The value is 5"

### 3. Package for release

Now that we've got a working app, let's package up all of our required files in an easy to distribute format. This time, we'll specify the Release configuration. In a terminal, run:

```
dotnet publish -c Release
```

By default, this places your app files in a folder named `/bin/Release/netcoreapp1.1/publish`. We'll use this output path in our next step when we build a Docker image for our app.

## Working with Docker

### 1. Building a Docker Image

In the root of your app, in your `api` folder, create a new file named `Dockerfile` Note, in some editors like Visual Studio 2017, you may need to create a new text file, then remove the .txt extension. Update the file to the following:

```Dockerfile
# Use the aspnetcore image as a base
FROM microsoft/aspnetcore:1.1

# Use /app inside the created container to hold our files
WORKDIR /app

# Copy our app into the current folder (/app)
# Note we used the path from the previous step
COPY ./bin/Release/netcoreapp1.1/publish .

# Set an environment variable to listen on all addresses using port 80
ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS http://+:80

# Expose port 80 from our created container
EXPOSE 80

# Run our app using "dotnet api.dll"
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "api.dll"]
```

In a terminal, we'll build our image, giving it a name of `api` and a tag of `1`.
```
docker build -t api:1 .
```

### 2. Running locally on Docker

You're ready to run your app on your local Docker host. In a terminal:

```
docker run -d --name myapi -p 8080:80 api:1
```

Several interesting things are going on here. A quick breakdown:

|Argument|Description|
|---|---|
| `run` | tells Docker to run a new container |
| `-d` | run the container in the background |
| `--name myapi` | give the container a friendly name so we can find it easily later |
| `-p 8080:80` | map the port 8080 on the host (your computer) to port 80 inside the container |
| `api:1` | the image to be run is `api`, with the tag `1` <br/> Note: in Docker, tags are used as version numbers, in our case version 1 |

Now that your app is running in a container on your local Docker host, you can see it by running the following in a terminal:

```
docker ps
```

Note the port mapping from `0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp`. That means you can interact with your app by navigating to [http://localhost:8080/api/values/5](http://localhost:8080/api/values/5)

Docker containers come and go frequently. We'll stop our currently running container to free up some computing resources and port 8080 on our host for future work.  In a terminal, run the following:

```
docker stop myapi
```

Your container is now stopped. To verify, run:

```
docker ps
```

Note that the container still exists, it's just not currently running. You can see it by listing all containers by running:

```
docker ps -a
```

To restart your container, run:

```
docker start myapi
```

You'll see that your app is back up and running, and [http://localhost:8080/api/values/5](http://localhost:8080/api/values/5) is available once again

Finally, destroy your container by running:

```
docker stop myapi
docker rm myapi
```

## Deploying to a Docker Registry

So far, we've developed an app, packaged it in a Docker image, and have tested it in a production-like environment by running it inside a container on our local computer. To get it running in the cloud, our next step is to push our image to a Docker registry.

We're going to create a private registry to hold our images, using [Azure Container Registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-intro). We'll do this for a few reasons. First, we want to make sure our images aren't available to just anyone on the Internet, and we want to be able to control access to our images. We also want our images to be available in the same region as our compute resources.

### 1. Create an Azure Container Registry

Using the Azure Cloud Shell, set up some variables for your registry. These will be specific to you:

```
RESOURCE_GROUP=myResourceGroup
ACR_NAME=buildtourregistry
```

Next, use the following command, which uses the `--admin-enabled` switch to allow a simple username/password logon, to create your container registry:

```
az acr create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $ACR_NAME --sku Basic --admin-enabled
```

You're all set up with a registry, with the full name of `$ACR_NAME.azurecr.io`.

Execute the following command to get the admin password for your newly created registry:

```
az acr credential show -n $ACR_NAME -g $RESOURCE_GROUP
```

### 2. Connect to Your Registry

Hop back over to a local terminal. Let's login to our registry so we can push an image. Run the following command:

```
docker login
```

You'll be prompted for a username & a password. Your `Username` is the short name of your container registry (the value you specified for `$ACR_NAME` previously). Your `Password` will be either one of the `password` or `password2` results from the previous command.

### 3. Push an Image

It's time to tag and push our image. We've already got an image tagged `api:1`, but we need to tell Docker to associate it with our newly created private registry. To do that, use the following command, substituting `$ACR_NAME` with the short name of your Azure Container Registry.

```
docker tag api:1 $ACR_NAME.azurecr.io/api:1
```

To push your newly tagged image to your private registry, use the following command:

```
docker push $ACR_NAME.azurecr.io/api:1
```

When this completes, you can see the repository (`api`) and the tag (`1`) have been created by using the following:

```
az acr repository list -n $ACR_NAME
az acr repository show-tags -n $ACR_NAME --repository api
```
