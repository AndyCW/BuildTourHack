# Task 1.2.1 - Install App Locally for Testing

## Prerequisites 

This task has a dependency on [Task 1.1.2](112_GeneratePWA.md) and all of it's prerequisites

## Task 

### Test the App in Browsers

The first thing you want to do is make sure your PWA works well in the browser.  One of the main principles of PWAs is that the app must be "Progressive".  This means the app should work in any environment, then start taking advantage of advanced features (such as service workers and app manifest) when they are available.  In normal circumstances, you would want to test your app in the array of browsers used by your user.   To get you started, we have the newest version of Edge (with service worker support) available to you for free on browser stack

1.  In your browser, visit https://www.browserstack.com/test-on-microsoft-edge-browser

2. Create an account if you don't already have one.

3. Choose Windows > 10 > Edge 16 > new session to get started testing in Edge

4. You can also use browser stack to test in other browsers you don't have installed on your device (trial limitations apply)

### Install Windows Store PWA locally
The next environment you'll want to test in, is the local PWA.  To do this we'll use more tools from PWABuilder.com

1. In the browser, open www.pwabuilder.com/generate.

2. Enter your site URL and press "get started".  If you have your manifest properly linked to your page, you should see the data from your manifest (including images) show up in the builder.

3. Click on the 3rd tab called "Publish PWA".  This time you'll click on the "windows" source code button and download the package.

4. Inside the zip, decompress it and navigate to PWA>Store apps> WIndows10 and right click on the "test app" script.   

5. Follow the prompts to "side load the application".

6. open the app from your start screen / start menu.  Your now experiencing your PWA on Windows 10!

### F12 with Windows Store PWA

Your app is sideloaded on your machine, which means it's in debug mode.  While PWAs are in debug mode on Windows 10, you have access to the same f12 tools you do while in the Edge browser.  While the app in forefront on your screen, hit the "f12" button on your keyboard and the tools should open.

Push API for service worker is currently at risk for RS3, so unlikely weâ€™ll have docs (or a usable feature) by early June. For now JS apps would have to do push with WinRT: https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/Notifications/js
