# Task 3.5.1 - Create a Customer Bot

Our users want to be able to check and modify the status of their orders from anywhere, including chat bot platforms like Skype and Facebook. They'd also like to send feedback and create support tickets from the bot.

## Prerequisites 

This task has a dependency on [Tasks under section 4](../4/411_DocumentDB.md) and all of their prerequisites

## Task

1. Create a bot using the Microsoft Bot Framework that asks for the user to log in (MVP would be asking for the user account id). 
2. Once the user logs in, the bot can list user orders, find a specific order status from an Order ID, cancel the order if it hasn't been shipped
3. The bot also allows the user to open support tickets and send feedback

###### @ 9:02am
I've done a but of investigation, found these samples [in C#](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/CSharp/) and [in Node.js](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/Node) that should help us get started. the core-MultiDialogs and the cards-CarouselCards samples seem interesting.

###### @ 9:23am
If the bot asks the user to sign in we can use this [nice library called BotAuth](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/richard_dizeregas_blog/2017/05/15/bot-authentication-in-the-bot-framework/) for it.  

###### @ 10:31am
We can get our bot to call the [Orders API](../4/412_OrdersAPI.md) to get order details for the user. 

###### @ 11:05am
We can use Microsoft Cognitive Services to enhance our bot, like the [Language Understanding Intelligent Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/language-understanding-intelligent-service/) to [understand commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/cognitive-services-bot-intelligence-overview#language-understanding) and the [Text Analytics API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics/) for sentiment analysis of feedback.
